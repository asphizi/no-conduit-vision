# No Conduit Vision

This Minecraft Fabric mod allows the player to remove or toggle the night vision effect given by conduit power when underwater

## Usage

Once installed, the night vision effect given by conduits is turned off by default.
To turn it back on, you can set a keybind (unbound by default) to toggle the effect
or edit the config file `no-conduit-vision.json5` (with ModMenu support.)
